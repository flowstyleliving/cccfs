        <h2 id="ro">ROMEO</h2>
      <p id="rope">
        I take thee at thy word:<br>
        Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;<br>
        Henceforth I never will be Romeo.<br>
      </p>

        <h2 id="ju">JULIET</h2>
      <p id="jupe">
    What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
    So stumblest on my counsel?
      </p>
        <h2 id="ro">ROMEO</h2>
      <p id="rope">
    By a name
    I know not how to tell thee who I am:
    My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
    Because it is an enemy to thee;
    Had I it written, I would tear the word.
      </p>
        <h2 id="ju">JULIET</h2>
      <p id="jupe">
    My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
    Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
    Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
      </p>
        <h2 id="ro">ROMEO</h2>
      <p id="rope">
    Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
      </p>
        <h2 id="ju">JULIET</h2>
      <p id="jupe">
    How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
    The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
    And the place death, considering who thou art,
    If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
      </p>
        <h2 id="ro">ROMEO</h2>
      <p id="rope">
    With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
    For stony limits cannot hold love out,
    And what love can do that dares love attempt;
    Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
      </p>
        <h2 id="ju">JULIET</h2>
      <p id="jupe">
    If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
      </p>
        <h2 id="ro">ROMEO</h2>
      <p id="rope">
    Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
    Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
    And I am proof against their enmity.
      </p>
        <h2 id="ju">JULIET</h2>
      <p id="jupe">
    I would not for the world they saw thee here.
      </p>
